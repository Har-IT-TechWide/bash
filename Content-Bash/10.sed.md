- The sed command is a stream editor used for quick and powerful text transformations on files or data streams.
- Basic usage involves substituting text patterns with the syntax sed 's/old/new/' filename.
- Key options include:
  - -i to edit files in place without separately saving,
  - -n to suppress automatic printing,
  - -r to enable extended regular expressions,
  - -f to execute a script from a file,
  - -l to specify line length for output formatting.
- sed outputs changes to standard output by default; to save changes, redirect output to a file or use -i for in-place edits.
- Advanced text processing with sed can add prefixes or perform complex substitutions.
- Common errors often relate to syntax issues or file accessibility; debugging can be done by printing intermediate results.

- The `sed` command is a stream editor for performing basic text transformations on files or input streams, useful for quick edits.
- Basic usage involves pattern replacement like `sed 's/old/new/' filename` to replace the first occurrence of a pattern.
- Key options include `-i` (edit files in place), `-n` (suppress automatic printing), `-r` (use extended regular expressions), `-f` (execute script from file), and `-l` (specify line length for printing).
- Without `-i`, changes are output to standard output and must be redirected to save; `-n` combined with `p` controls which lines print.
- Extended regex via `-r` allows more powerful pattern matching; scripts with multiple commands can be loaded from files with `-f`.
- You can redirect the output to new files to avoid overwriting originals; advanced processing includes adding prefixes or complex substitutions.
- Common errors include syntax problems ("sed: command garbled") and file access issues; debugging tips include printing intermediate results with `echo`.
