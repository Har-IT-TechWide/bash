- The sed command is a stream editor used for quick and powerful text transformations on files or data streams.
- Basic usage involves substituting text patterns with the syntax sed 's/old/new/' filename.
- Key options include:
  - -i to edit files in place without separately saving,
  - -n to suppress automatic printing,
  - -r to enable extended regular expressions,
  - -f to execute a script from a file,
  - -l to specify line length for output formatting.
- sed outputs changes to standard output by default; to save changes, redirect output to a file or use -i for in-place edits.
- Advanced text processing with sed can add prefixes or perform complex substitutions.
- Common errors often relate to syntax issues or file accessibility; debugging can be done by printing intermediate results.
