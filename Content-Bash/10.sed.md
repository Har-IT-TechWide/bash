- The `sed` command is a stream editor for performing basic text transformations on files or input streams, useful for quick edits.
- Basic usage involves pattern replacement like `sed 's/old/new/' filename` to replace the first occurrence of a pattern.
- Key options include
  - `-i` (edit files in place),
  - `-n` (suppress automatic printing),
  - `-r` (use extended regular expressions),
  - `-f` (execute script from file), and
  - `-l` (specify line length for printing).
- Without `-i`, changes are output to standard output and must be redirected to save; `-n` combined with `p` controls which lines print.
- Extended regex via `-r` allows more powerful pattern matching; scripts with multiple commands can be loaded from files with `-f`.
- You can redirect the output to new files to avoid overwriting originals; advanced processing includes adding prefixes or complex substitutions.
- Common errors include syntax problems ("sed: command garbled") and file access issues; debugging tips include printing intermediate results with `echo`.
